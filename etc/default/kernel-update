# How to run kernel configuration:
# "ask"  - use config from previous kernel, ask user for new symbols
# "menu" - same as "ask", then run ncurses tool for modifications
# empty (default) - use config from previous kernel, and apply defaults for
#                   new symbols. Fully automated, for unattended upgrades.
